# Generalisation Capacities of Hebbian Predictive Coding Neural Networks and Influence of Learning from Naturalistic Visual Sequences

Year 1 Research project 
University of Amsterdam

Research in the past decades has revealed that the ventral visual stream is capable of extracting identity and object information from raw visual input through a series of hierarchical processing stages. Ample evidence suggests that in addition to feedforward processing, feedback signals modulated by expectation from higher cognitive areas also play an important functional role in visual perception, providing support for the predictive coding theory of sensory processing. However, few computational studies have modelled visual representation learning using networks with both feedforward and feedback connections as postulated by the predictive processing framework. In this exploratory study, we build a biologically plausible Hebbian Predictive Coding Network to study visual representation learning and generalisation in an object categorisation task. We tested the effect of spatiotemporal image statistics present in continuously transforming objects and the size of learning sets on the network generalisation capacity. While we demonstrated that with our training paradigm networks are capable of achieving good performance on object categorisation, results showed no direct impact of the spatiotemporal image statistics from continuous object transformations on improving generalisation. We discuss the implications of these results on generalisation capacities of the visual system and point to potential future research directions.
